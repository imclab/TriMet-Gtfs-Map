# TriMet maps from GTFS using python

GTFS is a [General Transit Feed Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification), an arbitrary format database created by Google along with [Portland's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) transit authority [TriMet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimet).
 
The GTFS is downloadable as csv files in a zip. 
 
## What this does
 
This package contains scripts to put the database back into a database (sqllite) and analyze the movement of buses and trains in the system visually. 
 
## How to use
 
I built this mostly as bits and pieces of code to do particular tasks. Look through the code and use the useful ones with trimet data or transit data from any other source that uses GTFS to describe itself.
 
    # Run the script end to end
    
    $ ./run.py
